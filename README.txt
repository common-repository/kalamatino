double check that your selected text in "from" field should be same as the text you want to replace.
if the source text has for example extra html tags , replacement doesn't work!

currect example:
source: `<h4>i don't like this text</h4>`
from: i don't like this text
to: your custom text
// this will work!

wrong example:
source: `<h4>i <strong>don't like</strong> this text</h4>`
from: i don't like this text
